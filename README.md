# Design Patterns Overview

Welcome to the Design Patterns documentation. This README provides an overview of commonly used design patterns, categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Each pattern is a proven solution to a common software design problem, offering a way to create flexible and reusable code.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Singleton
**Intent:** Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

**Use Case:** Managing a shared resource, such as a database connection or a logging service.

### Factory Method
**Intent:** Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Use Case:** When the exact type of the object depends on dynamic conditions during runtime.

### Abstract Factory
**Intent:** Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Use Case:** When a system needs to be independent of the way its objects are created.

### Builder
**Intent:** Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

**Use Case:** Constructing objects with a large number of optional parameters or configurations.

### Prototype
**Intent:** Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

**Use Case:** When the cost of creating an object is high and copying an existing object is more efficient.

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

### Adapter
**Intent:** Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, allowing classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.

**Use Case:** Integrating a new component into an existing system without changing the system's interface.

### Bridge
**Intent:** Separate an object's interface from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

**Use Case:** When you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.

### Composite
**Intent:** Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

**Use Case:** Managing hierarchical, recursive structures like file systems or organizational structures.

### Decorator
**Intent:** Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

**Use Case:** Adding features to objects at runtime without altering their structure.

### Facade
**Intent:** Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

**Use Case:** Simplifying client interactions with complex systems.

### Flyweight
**Intent:** Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

**Use Case:** When a large number of objects should be controlled to reduce memory usage.

### Proxy
**Intent:** Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

**Use Case:** Lazy initialization, access control, or logging requests.

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, making the interaction flexible and intuitive.

### Chain of Responsibility
**Intent:** Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.

**Use Case:** When multiple objects can handle a request, and the handler is determined at runtime.

### Command
**Intent:** Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.

**Use Case:** Implementing undo/redo functionality in applications.

### Interpreter
**Intent:** Define a grammatical representation for a language and an interpreter to interpret the grammar.

**Use Case:** Parsing and interpreting expressions or statements in a language.

### Iterator
**Intent:** Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

**Use Case:** Traversing through a collection of objects.

### Mediator
**Intent:** Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.

**Use Case:** Managing complex interactions and dependencies between multiple objects.

### Memento
**Intent:** Capture and externalize an object's internal state so that it can be restored later.

**Use Case:** Implementing checkpoints or undo mechanisms.

### Observer
**Intent:** Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Use Case:** Implementing event handling systems.

### State
**Intent:** Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.

**Use Case:** Managing an object with different behaviors for different states.

### Strategy
**Intent:** Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

**Use Case:** Implementing different methods of data sorting, compression, or other operations.

### Template Method
**Intent:** Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.

**Use Case:** Generalizing code with common structure but varying details.

### Visitor
**Intent:** Represent an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure, allowing new operations to be defined without changing the classes of the elements.

**Use Case:** Adding operations to complex object structures without modifying the structures.
